# Project Description: Unique Bank Management System

The "Unique Bank" is a Python script designed to perform the basic operations of a bank system. This system allows users to create accounts, log in, check their account balances, deposit and withdraw funds, and even transfer money between accounts.

The project consists of two main files:

[**UNIQUE_BANK.py:**](./UNIQUE_BANK.py) This file contains the Python code for the Unique Bank application.

[**USER.db:**](./USER.db) This appears to be in SQLite database file storing user account information.

## Key features and functionalities:

**Account Creation:** Users can create new bank accounts with unique account numbers and PINs. The system generates a new account number automatically.

**Logging In:** Account holders can log in using their account number and PIN for secure access to their accounts.

**Account Information:** Users can view their account balances to check the available funds.

**Deposits:** Account holders can deposit money into their accounts. The system ensures that the deposited amount is valid.

**Withdrawals:** Users can withdraw funds from their accounts if they have sufficient balance.

**Money Transfer:** Account holders can transfer money to other accounts within the bank, provided they know the recipient's account number and the recipient's account exists.

**Error Handling:** The system includes error handling to validate user inputs and prevent invalid operations.

**Interactive Menu:** Users can navigate through a menu-driven interface to access various banking services.

This project is a simple example of how to create a console-based banking application using Python, with basic account management features.
